# Practice Drill 1
1) mkdir → to create Directories
   ->mkdir -p hello/five/six/seven hello/one/two/three/four 
    note: p → Creates parent directories if they do not exist.
    
2) creating files
touch → command is used to create empty file
touch hello/five/six/c.txt
cd hello/five/six/seven
touch error.log
cd ../../../../one
touch a.txt b.txt
cd two
touch d.txt
cd three
mkdir four
cd four
touch access.log
    
3)Tree diagram of folders and files
    
hello
├── five
│   └── six
│       ├── c.txt
│       └── seven
│           └── error.log
└── one
    ├── a.txt
    ├── b.txt
    └── two
        ├── d.txt
        └── three
            ├── e.txt
            └── four
                └── access.log

4)Delete all the files having the .log extension
 ->find hello -type f -name ‘*.log’ -delete 
    This command finds all files with the ".log" extension in the hello directory by specifying -type f (for files), then deletes them.

5)Add the following content to a.txt
    way 1->nano hello/one/a.txt
    (this will overwrite previous content)
    
    way 2->cat >> hello/one/a.txt 
    (this will not overwrite the existing content in the file). 
    

6)Delete the directory named five
  ->rm -r hello/five
   note1: rmdir → to delete empty directory
   note2: m -R or -r → it is used to delete recursively if the directory is not empty
    
 7)Rename the one directory to uno
 ->mv hello/one hello/uno 
  
  ->mv hello/uno/a.txt hello/two 
   
  note: mv → to rename or move file from source to target directory
