File Management

1)Download File
way1-> To download only
wget "Harrypotter.txt "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobdeng/owlreader/master/ERead/assets/books/Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Goblet%20of%20Fire.txt"

way2-> To download and rename ad the same time
wget -O HarryPotter.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobdeng/owlreader/master/ERead/assets/books/Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Goblet%20of%20Fire.txt

2)Display Top 3 Lines
->head -3 Harrypotter.txt


3)Display Bottom 10 Lines
->tail -10 Harrypotter.txt

4) Count Specific Word Occurrences
->grep -oi Harry Harrypotter.txt | wc -l
->grep -oi Ron Harrypotter.txt | wc -l
->grep -oi Hermione Harrypotter.txt | wc -l
->grep -oi Dumbledore Harrypotter.txt | wc -l

grep → A command used to search for patterns in a file.
-o → Prints only the matching text (each match appears on a new line).
-i → Ignores case sensitivity, so it will match Dumbledore, dumbledore, or DUMBLEDORE.

wc -l → Counts the number of lines in the output (each match appears on a separate line, making this count the number of matches)

5)Print Lines 100 to 200-
->head -200 Harrypotter.txt | tail -100


6)Unique Word Count
way1->tr -cs '[:alpha:]' '\n' < Harrypotter.txt | sort | uniq-i | wc -l
way2->grep -oE '\b[[:alpha:]]+b\' HarryPotter.txt | sort | uniq -i | wc -l
   a)tr -cs '[:alpha:]' '\n'	
    -c: Matches everything except letters.
    -s: Squeezes multiple non-alphabetic characters into one.
    '[:alpha:]': Matches letters only (ignores numbers and symbols).
    '\n': Replaces unwanted characters with newlines.

   b)sort
      standard sorting (case-sensitive by default).

   c)uniq -i
       -i: Ensures case insensitivity when identifying unique words.
    d)wc -l
	counts the number of lines, representing the number of unique words.

Process & Ports Management

1)List your browser's process ids (pid) and parent process ids(ppid)
->ps -ef | grep firefox
Note:ps -ef: Lists all running processes with detailed information.
     grep firefox: Filters the output to show only processes related to the firefox browser.
     PID: Process ID (unique identifier of each running process).
     PPID: Parent Process ID (the ID of the process that started this process)	.

2)Stop the browser application from the command line
-> pkill firefox
    Note:pkill: Kills a process by its name.
	This command will stop all running Firefox processes.
	You can replace firefox with your browser name like chrome or brave.

3)Top 3 CPU-Consuming Processes
->ps -eo pid,ppid,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head -4


4T)op 3 Memory-Consuming Processes
->ps -eo pid,ppid,%mem --sort=-%mem | head -4
Note:-ps:Stands for Process Status — shows details about running processes.
     -e:Displays all processes (not just those associated with the current terminal).
     -o:Specifies a custom output format for the process details.

5)Create Python Server on Port 8000
->python3 -m http.server 8000

6)Stop the Python Server
way 1->lsof -i:8000(if it running on port-8000)
way 2->ps -eo pid,cmd | grep python (if we dont know the port no.)
     ->lsof -i:8000


7)Python Server on Port 90
->sudo python3 -m http.server 90
Note: we are using sudo here because, in Linux port 1-1023 are previlged(they require root permissions)


8)Display all active connections and the corresponding TCP / UDP ports.
way1->netstat -tuln
way2->ss -tuln
   Note:-netstat — Displays network-related information like connections, routing tables, etc.
        -ss — A faster and more modern alternative to netstat for displaying socket information
	-t — Show TCP connections.
	-u — Show UDP connections.
	-l — Show only listening ports (ignores established or closed connections).
	-n — Show numeric addresses instead of resolving them to hostnames for faster output.
	

9)Find PID of Process Listening on Port 5432
->ss -tunlp | grep :5432
Note:-p — Show the process name and PID associated with the socket.

Software Management

1) Install Software
->sudo apt install vim

2)Uninstall Software
->sudo apt uninstall nginx

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Miscellaneous

1)Get IP Address
->ip a | grep inet
->hostname -i


2)Find the IP address of google.com
->nslookup google.com


3) How to check if Internet is working using CLI?
way1->ping google.com
way->nslookup google.com

4)Where is the node command located? What about code?
->whereis node
->which node
